# Mandarin Vocabularies

A premium, interactive Mandarin Chinese vocabulary study tool built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. Covers both **HSK 2.0** (6 levels) and **HSK 3.0** (9 levels) standards with pronunciation audio powered by the Web Speech API.

## ✨ Features

- **Dual HSK Standards** — Browse both HSK 2.0 (classic 6 levels) and HSK 3.0 (new 9-level framework) in one app.
- **Global Navigation Bar** — A sticky, glassmorphism-styled navbar lets you instantly switch between HSK versions.
- **Interactive Flashcards** — Click any vocabulary card to reveal the Pinyin and English translation with a smooth animation.
- **Pronunciation Audio** — Each card plays the Mandarin pronunciation using the browser's built-in Web Speech API (`zh-CN`).
- **Statically Generated** — All 20 routes are statically pre-rendered at build time for instant page loads.
- **Modern Design** — Dark mode support, gradient typography, smooth micro-animations, and responsive grid layout.
